## **[Integrative Multi-Omics Profiling of Rhabdomyosarcoma Subtypes Reveals Distinct Molecular Pathways and Biomarker Signatures](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4409/14/14/1115)**  
Applied Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) across metabolomics and proteomics data to delineate patterns of co-expressed genes in rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS). Co-expressed modules were identified through hierarchical clustering, and the Wilcoxon test assessed module eigengene differentiation, revealing RMS subtype-specific molecular profiles. 
To pinpoint central molecular drivers, proteinâ€“protein interaction networks were constructed by integrating WGCNA hub proteins with differentially expressed proteins, and centrality measures were applied to identify key regulators within each RMS subtype.
